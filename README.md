# VeChain Smart Accounts Factory

<div align="center">
  <img src="apps/frontend/src/assets/logo.png" alt="Logo" width="200"/>

  <p>Simplified version of the <a href="https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction" target="_blank">Account Abstraction pattern<a> for the vechain blockchain.</p>
</div>

There are 2 contracts (that you can find in the `packages/contracts/contracts` folder):

- **SimpleAccount**: Is the abstracted account of the user.
- **SimpleAccountFactory**: Factory contract to create SimpleAccount contracts on demand.

You can fork the contracts and deploy them on your own, but we recommend using the contracts deployed by us for a better cross-app compatibility.

Owner of the Simple Account can execute transactions called directly from him or authorized via signatures and broadcasted by a third party.

### Contracts (packages/contracts) 📜

Smart contract in Solidity, managed with Hardhat for deployment on the Vechain Thor network.

### Packages 📦

Shared configurations and utility functions to unify and simplify your development process.

### Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies with ease:

```bash
yarn # Run this at the root level of the project
```

Place your `.env` files in the root folder, you can copy `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` changing the values to your own.

## Running the frontend with the deployed contracts

```bash
  yarn dev:mainnet
```

## Deploy the contracts by yourself

### Deploy the contracts on the Testnet:

```bash
  yarn contracts:deploy:testnet
```

### Run the frontend to interact with the contracts on the Testnet:

```bash
  yarn dev:testnet
```
